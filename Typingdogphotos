# Dog Typing Photo App - Plan

## Concept Overview
An interactive typing app where:
- User types a word at the beginning (e.g., "DOG", "HAPPY", "PUPPY")
- Every letter typed displays a dog photo
- The dog photos are selected based on the letters in the initial word

## Design Approaches (Choose One)

### Approach 1: Letter-to-Photo Mapping
- Each letter in the initial word maps to a specific dog photo
- Example: Word "DOG" → D maps to photo 1, O maps to photo 2, G maps to photo 3
- When user types "A", it shows the photo for "D" (first letter)
- When user types "B", it shows the photo for "O" (second letter)
- Cycles through letters of the word

### Approach 2: Random Selection from Letter Pool
- Each letter in the initial word has multiple associated dog photos
- When typing, randomly pick from photos associated with letters in the word
- Example: Word "DOG" → typing could show any dog photo mapped to D, O, or G

### Approach 3: Sequential Cycle
- User types initial word "DOG"
- Every letter typed cycles through photos: D-photo → O-photo → G-photo → D-photo...
- Letter position in typed sequence determines which letter from word to use

### Approach 4: Letter Position Based
- Initial word determines available photos
- Each letter typed shows photo based on position: 1st typed letter = 1st word letter, 2nd = 2nd, etc.
- Wraps around if word is shorter than typed sequence

## Recommended Approach: **Approach 4 (Letter Position Based)**

This is the most intuitive and fun:
- Type word "PUPPY" → photos cycle: P → U → P → P → Y → P → U → P...
- Simple to understand and implement
- Creates a visual typing rhythm

## Technical Implementation Plan

### 1. **HTML Structure**
- Text input field for typing
- Display area for dog photos
- Optional: Show current word being used
- Optional: Display current letter index

### 2. **Dog Photo API/Data Source**
- Use Dog API (https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random) for random dog photos
- OR use Unsplash API for dog photos
- OR curate a set of dog photo URLs
- Preload photos for smooth experience

### 3. **Core Logic Flow**
```
1. User types initial word → store as "baseWord"
2. Set letterIndex = 0
3. On each keystroke:
   - Get letter from baseWord[letterIndex % baseWord.length]
   - Fetch/show dog photo (could be random or mapped to that letter)
   - Increment letterIndex
```

### 4. **Features to Include**
- ✅ Input field for typing
- ✅ Dog photo display area
- ✅ Show the word being used
- ✅ Visual feedback for each letter typed
- ✅ Optional: Letter counter
- ✅ Optional: Reset/change word button

### 5. **Styling Considerations**
- Clean, minimal UI
- Large photo display
- Smooth transitions between photos
- Mobile-friendly responsive design

## File Structure
```
/
  - dog-typing-app.html (main app)
  - styles.css (optional, can be inline)
  - script.js (optional, can be inline)
```

---

## Implementation Steps
1. Create HTML structure with input and photo display
2. Add event listener for keyboard input
3. Implement letter cycling logic based on initial word
4. Integrate dog photo API or image array
5. Add visual transitions and animations
6. Style the interface
7. Test with different words
8. Optional: Add word reset functionality

---

## Example User Flow
1. User opens app → sees empty input field
2. User types: "HAPPY" → word is captured
3. User continues typing: "hello world"
   - Types 'h' → shows dog photo for 'H' (1st letter of HAPPY)
   - Types 'e' → shows dog photo for 'A' (2nd letter of HAPPY)
   - Types 'l' → shows dog photo for 'P' (3rd letter of HAPPY)
   - Types 'l' → shows dog photo for 'P' (4th letter of HAPPY)
   - Types 'o' → shows dog photo for 'Y' (5th letter of HAPPY)
   - Types space → shows dog photo for 'H' (wraps to 1st letter)
   - And so on...

---

## Questions to Decide
- Should the initial word be typed in a special input, or just the first word typed?
- Should we ignore spaces and special characters, or include them in the cycle?
- Do you want photos to be random or consistent (same letter = same photo)?
- How long should each photo be displayed? (instant replacement or fade transition?)
